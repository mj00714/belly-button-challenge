# belly-button-challenge

### Overview

Not going to lie, this challenge turned my stomach a bit... pun intended. 

The goal of this challenge was to build an interactive dashboard, utilizing JavaScript and supporting libraries (ie, d3). 

Information about the study and the underlying data can be found at:

D3 libraries were used to connect to the JSON data source. One best practice that I'm establishing from class lectures is displaying the output in the browser inspector, using ```console.log()```. This allows me to analyze the data structure before constructing the code. 

After examining the data structure, the first chart was created and (later)initialized with the first sample data. Again, the d3 library is used. The data is labeled for use in later charts. 

Next, the bubble chart is created and a different function is used to display the metadata. 

Finally, we use the ```optionChanged``` function to toggle between samples, as selected by the user. 

### Conclusion
This was a great intro to fully customizable charts, which can be created using JavaScript. These types of visualizations will be helpful in applications where iFrames are called on websites and custom microservices.
